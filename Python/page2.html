                <p>When you teach, you tell everyone that it's easy
                <p>When you code, you're kinda teaching yourself...
                <p>When I code for someone else, I'm always telling them how time consuming it is
                <p>It's too bad that we don't advise ourselves with the same kind of caution
                <p>Use Cases:
                <li>Students without the knowledge required for critical reasoning
                <li>Instructor with only 5min to grade your work
                <li>People who see potential and want to carry on the work
