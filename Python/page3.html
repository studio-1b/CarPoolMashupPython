    First, you should know that this wasn't originally going to be javascript front-end.
    It was just supposed to be a 8hr implementation of a http server.
    Static pages, no fancy scripting on either end.

    <p><img src="singlethreadhttpd.png"/></p>
    What you are looking at (above) is about 800lines of python code, single threaded,
    that looks for a file named after the GET instruction and outputs the file with
    HTTP response header pre-pended.  That all you need to serve webpages.

    <p>This is the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/misc/relevant_standards.html">RFC for HTTP linked to by apache</a>...</p>

    <h1>So, no you can't do that in 8hrs</h1>

    You can implement GET method, and return static pages:
    <pre>
    GET /todaycgi.py HTTP/1.1
    ... HTTP Headers can be ignored for basic functionality ...
    \r\n\r\n'
    </pre>
    which returns
    <pre>
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK'
    Date: Sat, 20 Nov 2021 12:34:31 '
    Server: 192.168.1.79'
    Content-Type: text/html'
    Content-Length: 122'
    \n\n\r\n
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;title>Today's date and time&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    you are 127.0.0.1&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    But I got bored...
