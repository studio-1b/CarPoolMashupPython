    <p>Then I added a handler for files ending with *cgi.py.  Now it can run programs to create HTML or supported content on the fly.
    1 x python file
    1 x todaycgi.py to see it work

    <p>Then I decided to copy and paste some html from a Google maps implementation I did for fun a few years back.
    1x HTML file *.htm

    <p>Then I decided, wouldn't it be great to be able to load people and paths to the map
    2x json files *.json

    <p>Then I decided, why can't I create the json files on the fly
    1x file management component
    2x HTML registration forms *.html
    2x POST handler *cgi.py
    and a tribbles worth of json files for people, destinations and pools

    <i>At this point, a more responsible programmer would ask themselves about something abstractly called separation of concerns.</i>

    <p>Then I decided, wouldnt it be great to have all the json files indexed according to their type
    3x json of arrays of filenames

    <p>Then I realized I forgot markers on google maps have to have lat/long...
    now 1x python file to pull coordinates from google

    <p>Now It's trivial to order the car pool destinations, to be optimal if less than 10.
    So now 1x python file to organize the paths

    <p>Now I realize that I'm going to need a easier interface to provide with my application
     I modify a file and add menu and menus and menues and when you think your done, more menues.
    probably 1700 lines of code
    the http server needs to be multithreading,so another 20 lines.  No, I don't need to worry about concurrency.
    There is nothing shared between requests, that I need to manage.  If I wrote logs of HTTP request, then I have
    to manage that, as they all write to the same log file.  But I didn't.  50lines of code saved.

    <p>at this point separation of concerns is becoming a real issue as the radiation from the cell phone tower nearby
        keeps my brainwaves scrambled, and I'm having trouble keeping track of how many places
        I cut and pasted the same code everywhere.
        1x python to distill duplicated code, into a readable outline, hiding the mess underneath.
        But that is now like 10x python files I have to remove the old code.  Lots and lots of debugging
        saved maybe 200 lines of code, but it's a lot more readable now, until you get to the lower layers.
    <p>I kept the Google Maps javascript application out of the discussion so far bc it's a python course.
        But I assure you, there is as much javascript in the html file, to read and manage all those json files,
        as there are python lines of code to create them.
